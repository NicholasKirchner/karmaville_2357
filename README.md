This was a week 8 DBC exercise in speeding up loading a web page by optimizing database interactions.

# Welcome to KarmaVille

## Getting Started

KarmaVille uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).  Run the following commands to get started:

```text
$ git clone git://github.com/Devbootcamp/karmaville.git
$ cd karmaville
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
```

The `rake db:setup` command could take several minutes to run.
